# PURPOSE: Game Script Simulation Engine
#          Simulates within-game quarter-by-quarter dynamics to
#          model how score differentials affect player minutes
#          and stat accumulation. Captures effects that flat
#          multipliers miss: star players sitting in blowouts,
#          faster/slower pace depending on lead size, etc.
#
#          Result is blended with flat Quantum Matrix results (70%
#          flat, 30% game-script) since game-script adds signal
#          but is noisier than the proven flat simulation.
#
# CONNECTS TO: engine/simulation.py (blend_with_flat_simulation),
#              engine/minutes_model.py (minutes simulation)
# CONCEPTS COVERED: Game script modeling, score differential,
#                   quarter-by-quarter simulation, star player
