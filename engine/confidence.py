    Calculate a 0-100 SAFE Score (Statistical Analysis of Force & Edge) for a prop pick.

    Combines eight signal weights into a weighted score, applies four penalties,
    then assigns a tier label: Platinum, Gold, Silver, or Bronze.

    ## Weights (W1–W8)

    The base score is a weighted sum of seven independent factor scores (each 0–100),
    plus one optional penalty group, normalised to a 0–100 final score:

    | Signal | Weight | Variable |
    |--------|--------|----------|
    | W1 Line Sharpness Penalty | post-score deduction (0–8 pts) | ``line_sharpness_penalty`` |
    | W2 Edge Magnitude | 22% | ``WEIGHT_EDGE_MAGNITUDE`` |
    | W3 Directional Agreement | 20% | ``WEIGHT_DIRECTIONAL_AGREEMENT`` |
    | W4 Historical Consistency | 12% | ``WEIGHT_HISTORICAL_CONSISTENCY`` |
    | W5 Trap Line Penalty | post-score deduction (0–15 pts) | ``trap_line_penalty`` |
    | W6 Recent Form | 10% | ``WEIGHT_RECENT_FORM`` |
    | W7 Calibration Adjustment | post-score adjustment (±) | ``calibration_adjustment`` |
    | W8 Matchup Favorability | 10% | ``WEIGHT_MATCHUP_FAVORABILITY`` |

    Additional weighted inputs:
    - Probability Strength: 20% (``WEIGHT_PROBABILITY_STRENGTH``)
    - Sample Size (games played): 6% (``WEIGHT_SAMPLE_SIZE``)

    ## Penalties (P1–P4)

    | Penalty | Trigger | Effect |
    |---------|---------|--------|
    | P1 Low Edge | edge < SILVER_MIN_EDGE_PCT | Score capped below Silver |
    | P2 Low Probability | prob < tier minimum | Tier downgrade |
    | P3 High CV | CV > 0.45 | Variance penalty (5–15 pts) |
    | P4 Injury / availability | injury_status_penalty > 0 | Direct score reduction |

    Phase 1 C2/C3 additions:
    - Hard kill switches (C2): override tier after scoring based on
      probability and CV thresholds.
    - Raised tier thresholds + min edge gate (C3): higher bars for
      Platinum/Gold/Silver, and low-edge picks auto-flagged as avoid.

    Args:
        probability_over (float): P(over line), from simulation
        edge_percentage (float): How far from 50% in percentage
        directional_forces (dict): Forces pushing MORE vs LESS
            Keys: 'over_count', 'under_count', 'over_forces', 'under_forces'
        defense_factor (float): Opponent defense multiplier (< 1 = tough)
        stat_standard_deviation (float): Stat variability
        stat_average (float): Player's season average for this stat
        simulation_results (dict): Full Quantum Matrix Engine 5.6 output dict
        games_played (int, optional): Games in season (higher = more reliable)
        recent_form_ratio (float, optional): Last-5-game avg / season avg.
            > 1.0 means hot streak, < 1.0 means cold streak.
        line_sharpness_penalty (float, optional): Points to subtract when
            the line is set at the player's true average (W1 — sharp line).
            Typically 0-8 points. Passed in from edge_detection results.
        trap_line_penalty (float, optional): Points to subtract when a
            trap line is detected (W5 — bait line). Typically 0-15 points.
        calibration_adjustment (float, optional): Historical calibration
            offset in percentage points (W7). Positive = model overestimates,
            scores get reduced. Negative = model underestimates, scores go up.
        injury_status_penalty (float, optional): Points to subtract when the
            player has a concerning injury/availability status (e.g. Questionable,
            Doubtful). Typically 0-10 points. Default 0.0 (no penalty).
        stat_type (str, optional): The stat being evaluated (e.g. 'points',
            'points_rebounds'). Used to apply combo-stat confidence penalty.
        games_played_season (int, optional): Games played this season for
            Bayesian sample-size damping (3A). Distinct from games_played.
        alternative_probabilities (list of float, optional): Probabilities from
            other models/sources for multi-source agreement bonus (3B).
        streak_info (dict, optional): Streak context for momentum adjustment (3C).
            Keys: 'type' ('hot'|'cold'|'none'), 'length' (int).
        platform (str, optional): Betting platform name for tier premium (3D).
            E.g. 'FanDuel', 'DraftKings', 'PrizePicks Power'.

    """
    Enforce a healthy tier distribution to prevent overconfidence inflation. (3F)

    If more picks than expected are classified at high tiers, downgrade
    the weakest ones to maintain realistic tier proportions.

    BEGINNER NOTE: If the model gives 40% of picks a Platinum rating,
    something is wrong — real Platinums should be rare. This function
    enforces realistic maximums: ≤10% Platinum, ≤25% Gold.

    Args:
        all_picks_results (list of dict): Each dict is the output of
            calculate_confidence_score() for one pick.
        max_platinum_pct (float): Maximum fraction of picks allowed to be Platinum.
            Default 0.10 (10%).
        max_gold_pct (float): Maximum fraction of picks allowed to be Gold or better.
            Default 0.25 (25%).

    Returns:
        tuple: (adjusted_results: list of dict, any_downgrades_occurred: bool)

    Example:
        If 5 of 10 picks are Platinum (50% > 10% max):
        → downgrade the 4 weakest Platinums to Gold
        → return adjusted list + True (downgrades occurred)
