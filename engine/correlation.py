# PURPOSE: Player correlation modeling for parlay construction.
#          Models positive/negative teammate correlations, game-level
#          correlations from pace/total, and usage cannibalization.
# CONNECTS TO: engine/entry_optimizer.py, pages/4 (Entry Builder)
# CONCEPTS COVERED: Pearson correlation, Gaussian copula (simplified),
#                   usage rate, game environment correlation
# ============================================================

# BEGINNER NOTE: Correlation in parlays matters because if two players
# are positively correlated (e.g. both benefit from a fast-paced game),
# the joint probability of both going over is HIGHER than multiplying
# their individual probabilities. Negative correlation means one player's
# success hurts the other's chances (usage competition).
