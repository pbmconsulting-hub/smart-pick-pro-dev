# PURPOSE: Player-vs-Team Matchup History Engine
#          Tracks how a specific player has historically performed
#          AGAINST a specific team. Player-vs-team history is one
#          of the strongest predictors of prop bet outcomes, as
#          some players have persistent matchup advantages or
#          disadvantages vs specific teams.
#
# CONNECTS TO: engine/projections.py (matchup adjustment factor),
#              engine/edge_detection.py (Force 9: Historical Matchup)
# CONCEPTS COVERED: Historical matchup analysis, sample-size
