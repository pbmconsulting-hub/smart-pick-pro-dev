# PURPOSE: Fetch live, real NBA data from the nba_api library.
#          Pulls today's games, player stats, team stats, and
#          player game logs. Saves everything to CSV files so
#          the rest of the app works without any changes.
# CONNECTS TO: pages/8_🔄_Update_Data.py, data/data_manager.py
# CONCEPTS COVERED: APIs, rate limiting, CSV writing, error handling
#
# BEGINNER NOTE: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a
# way for programs to talk to each other. nba_api is a free Python
# library that talks to the NBA's official stats website for us.

def fetch_todays_players_only(todays_games, progress_callback=None, precomputed_injury_map=None):

    Fetch player stats ONLY for teams playing today.

    Streamlined pipeline:
    1. Identifies the teams playing today from todays_games
    2. Uses RosterEngine to get current rosters + live injury data in one pass
    3. Fetches ALL player season averages in ONE bulk LeagueDashPlayerStats call
    4. Pre-filters injured/inactive players using RosterEngine data before any
       further processing, avoiding wasted work
    5. Computes std devs from dynamic CV estimates — no per-player game log calls

    This approach reduces API calls from 380+ (one per player) to just 2-3 calls
    total and completes in seconds rather than 3-5+ minutes.

    Args:
        todays_games (list of dict): Tonight's games from fetch_todays_games()
        progress_callback (callable, optional): Called with (current, total, msg)
        precomputed_injury_map (dict, optional): Deprecated — no longer used.
            Injury data is sourced directly from RosterEngine inside this
            function. This parameter is kept for backward API compatibility
            but is silently ignored.

    Returns:
        bool: True if successful, False if the fetch failed.
