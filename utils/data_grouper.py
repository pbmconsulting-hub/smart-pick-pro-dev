# PURPOSE: Aggregate raw platform prop data by player so each
#          player becomes a single "Trading Card" entity with
#          all of their available bets compiled together.
#
# USAGE:
#   from utils.data_grouper import group_props_by_player
#   grouped = group_props_by_player(analysis_results, players_data, todays_games)
#   # grouped["LeBron James"] == {"vitals": {...}, "props": [prop1, prop2, ...]}

    Each player key maps to a dict containing:
    - ``vitals``: enriched player data from
      :func:`data.player_profile_service.enrich_player_data`
    - ``props``: list of every prop/analysis-result dict for that player

    Parameters
    ----------
    analysis_results : list[dict]
        Flat list of prop analysis result dicts. Each must contain
        at least ``"player_name"``.
    players_data : list[dict] | None
        Full players dataset for enrichment.
    todays_games : list[dict] | None
        Today's games for opponent resolution.

    Returns
    -------
    dict[str, dict]
        Mapping of ``player_name`` → ``{"vitals": dict, "props": list}``.
