    Identify all forces pushing the stat OVER or UNDER the line.

    Checks multiple factors: projection vs line, matchup,

            'vegas_spread' (positive = player's team favored)
        platform_lines (dict or None): Optional mapping of platform name
            to posted line (e.g. {'DraftKings': 24.5, 'FanDuel': 25.0}).
            Used for Market Consensus force (2A).
        recent_form_ratio (float or None): Ratio of recent-game average to
            season average (e.g. 1.25 = running 25% above average).
            Used for Regression-to-Mean force (2F).

def categorize_alt_lines(standard_line, available_lines):
    """
    Categorize alternate sportsbook prop lines relative to the standard line.

    Sportsbooks offer a primary "standard" Over/Under line plus a set of
    alternate lines at higher or lower thresholds.  This function splits
    those alternate lines into two categories:

    * **below_standard** — lines BELOW the standard line.
      These are safer floor bets; the player only needs to exceed a lower
      threshold to win.  High-probability, lower payout.

    * **above_standard** — lines ABOVE the standard line.
      These are high-risk / high-reward bets; the player must exceed a
      higher threshold.  Lower probability, higher payout.

    Analysis should only be triggered on ACTUAL bookmaker lines — never
    on hypothetical or generated lines.  Feed the output of this function
    directly to the statistical analysis pipeline to ensure only real
    sportsbook lines are evaluated.

    Args:
        standard_line (float): The primary median O/U projection set by the
            sportsbook for this player prop (e.g. SGA Points O/U = 31.5).
        available_lines (list of float): The remaining alternate lines
            offered by the bookmaker for the same player prop.  Do NOT
            include the standard_line itself in this list.
