    Run a full Quantum Matrix Engine 5.6 simulation for one player's one stat.

    Simulates `number_of_simulations` games, each with randomized
    minutes (blowout risk, foul trouble) and stat variance.
    Builds a distribution and calculates P(over line).
    Default recommended simulations: 2000.

    C5: Uses skew-normal distribution sampling instead of normal,
        with stat-type-specific skew parameters (right skew for NBA).
    C8: Optionally simulates minutes first, then scales per-minute rate,
        capturing the natural correlation between minutes and stats.
    1B: Quarter-aware fatigue decay reduces effective stat rate across Q1-Q4.
    1C: Garbage time adjustment recaps star-player minutes in blowouts.

    Args:
        projected_stat_average (float): Our projected mean for the stat
        stat_standard_deviation (float): Historical variability (std dev)
        prop_line (float): The betting line to beat
        number_of_simulations (int): How many games to simulate (default 2000)
        blowout_risk_factor (float): 0.0-1.0; higher = more blowout risk
            A blowout (big lead) means stars play fewer garbage-time mins
        pace_adjustment_factor (float): Multiplier for game pace (0.85-1.15)
            Faster game = more possessions = more stat opportunities
        matchup_adjustment_factor (float): Multiplier for opponent defense
            0.9 = tough defense, 1.1 = weak defense
        home_away_adjustment (float): Small home-court boost or penalty
            Typical: home=+0.02, away=-0.02
        rest_adjustment_factor (float): Adjustment for rest days
            Back-to-back game = tired player = slight negative adjustment
        stat_type (str, optional): Stat being simulated (e.g. 'threes',
            'fg3m', 'points'). Used for skew-normal param selection (C5)
            and for CV floor enforcement for three-point props.
        projected_minutes (float, optional): Projected minutes for tonight. (C8)
            When provided, enables the minutes-first simulation approach:
            each trial first draws simulated minutes, then scales the
            per-minute stat rate by those minutes.
        minutes_std (float, optional): Std dev of minutes distribution. (C8)
            Defaults to MINUTES_STD_DEFAULT (4.0) when projected_minutes
            is provided but minutes_std is not.
        recent_game_logs (list of float, optional): Player's recent game stat
            values for this stat type. (C11)
            When 15+ entries are provided, each Quantum Matrix Engine 5.6 trial samples
            from a KDE built from these logs (instead of skew-normal).
            This captures player-specific distribution shapes (e.g., a player
            who always scores 15 or 30 but never 22).
            Falls back to skew-normal when None or fewer than 15 logs.
        random_seed (int, optional): Seed for the random number generator.
            When provided, the simulation produces reproducible results
            across runs — useful for debugging and model validation.
            Defaults to None (non-deterministic / different each run).
        enable_fatigue_curve (bool): When True, applies quarter-aware fatigue
            decay (1B). Q4 stats are modestly lower than Q1. Default True.
        vegas_spread (float, optional): Vegas point spread (positive = player's
            team favored). Feeds into spread-total matrix for scenario weighting
            (1A). Defaults to None (neutral).
        game_total (float, optional): Vegas over/under total. Combined with
            vegas_spread for spread-total matrix weighting (1A).
            Defaults to None (uses 225.0 baseline).
        prop_target_line (float, optional): Quarantined main line from the
            DFS platform (set by ``quarantine_props()``).  When provided,
            probability evaluation and DFS metrics are computed STRICTLY
            against this line instead of ``prop_line``.  This prevents the
            engine from evaluating extreme alternate lines.
        platform (str, optional): Sportsbook name (``"PrizePicks"``,
            ``"DraftKings"``, ``"DraftKings Pick6"``, etc.).  When provided alongside
            ``prop_target_line``, DFS-specific flex breakeven thresholds
            and parlay EV metrics are embedded in the output dict.

    Returns:
        dict: Simulation results containing:
            - 'simulated_results': list of all simulated game stats
            - 'probability_over': float, P(result > line)
            - 'simulated_mean': float, average of simulated results
            - 'simulated_std': float, std dev of simulated results
            - 'percentile_10': float, 10th percentile (bad game)
            - 'percentile_50': float, median game
            - 'percentile_90': float, 90th percentile (great game)
            - 'ci_90_low': float, lower bound of 90% Wilson confidence interval
            - 'ci_90_high': float, upper bound of 90% Wilson confidence interval
            - 'simulations_run': int, actual simulations completed (may be

    Run an enhanced simulation blending QME and game-script results. (1F)

    Convenience wrapper that enables all new features and blends
    Quantum Matrix Engine results with game-script simulation (if available).
    Uses 70% QME weight + 30% game-script weight.

    BEGINNER NOTE: This is the recommended entry point for Neural Analysis.
    It uses every enhancement: fatigue curves, garbage time, momentum,
    spread-total matrix, and game-script blending.

    Args:
        projected_stat_average (float): Projected mean for the stat
        stat_standard_deviation (float): Historical variability (std dev)
        prop_line (float): The betting line to beat
        number_of_simulations (int): Simulations to run (default 2000)
        blowout_risk_factor (float): 0.0-1.0 blowout probability
        pace_adjustment_factor (float): Game pace multiplier
        matchup_adjustment_factor (float): Opponent defense multiplier
        home_away_adjustment (float): Home/away additive adjustment
        rest_adjustment_factor (float): Rest/fatigue multiplier
        stat_type (str, optional): Stat type for distribution selection

        minutes_std (float, optional): Std dev of minutes
        recent_game_logs (list of float, optional): Recent game stat values
        random_seed (int, optional): Seed for reproducible results
        vegas_spread (float, optional): Vegas point spread (positive = player's
            team is favored). Used for spread-total matrix weighting.
        game_total (float, optional): Vegas over/under total. Used for
            spread-total matrix weighting.
