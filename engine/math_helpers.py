    Draw a single random sample from a skew-normal distribution.

    NBA stats are right-skewed (hard floor at 0, occasional explosion games
    that pull the distribution right). Standard normal sampling underestimates
    the probability of big games and overestimates the floor.

    This implementation uses the standard composition method:
        1. Draw two independent standard normals u, v
        2. If skew_param == 0, return the standard normal (reduces to Gaussian)
        3. Else, compute the skew-normal variate using the sign trick
