# PURPOSE: Ensemble Prediction System — blends 3 independent
#          projection models to produce a more accurate, robust
#          prediction than any single model.
#
#          World-class prediction systems never rely on a single
#          model. By blending models with different information
#          sources (season avg, recent form, matchup history),
#          we reduce prediction variance and improve accuracy.
#
# CONNECTS TO: engine/projections.py (base projection),
#              engine/simulation.py (probability engine)
# CONCEPTS COVERED: Ensemble learning, inverse-variance weighting,
#                   model disagreement, blended projection
