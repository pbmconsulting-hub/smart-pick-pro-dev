# ============================================================
# FILE: data/nba_data_service.py
# PURPOSE: Thin delegation layer that routes all NBA data
#          retrieval through the local ETL database
#          (db/smartpicks.db).
#
#          This module preserves the public API that every page
#          and engine module imports (get_todays_games, etc.).
#
# POLICY: DB-ONLY — no live nba_api calls during predictions
#         or analysis.  Data must be populated by the ETL
#         initial pull *before* the app uses it.  If the data
#         is not in the database, an empty result is returned.
#
# DATA SOURCES:
#   1. Local SQLite DB (db/smartpicks.db) — populated by ETL
#   2. PrizePicks / Underdog / DraftKings (via platform_fetcher.py)
#      — props only, unchanged
