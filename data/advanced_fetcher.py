# ============================================================
# FILE: data/advanced_fetcher.py
# PURPOSE: High-level pre-game enrichment pipeline.
#          Given tonight's slate of games, pre-fetches all
#          advanced NBA data (team dashboards, lineups, player
#          metrics, rotation data, standings) in a single
#          coordinated batch and returns it keyed by game_id.
#
# CONNECTS TO:
#   - data/nba_live_fetcher.py — the NBA API gateway
#   - data/nba_data_service.py — public wrappers
#   - pages/9_📡_Smart_NBA_Data.py — "Deep Fetch" button
#
# USAGE:
#   from data.advanced_fetcher import enrich_tonights_slate
#   enriched = enrich_tonights_slate(games, progress_callback=st.progress)
#
# DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
#   - Respects rate limits (all calls route through nba_live_fetcher)
#   - Caches aggressively (HIST_TTL for historical, LIVE_TTL for live)
#   - Returns a nested dict keyed by game_id with all enrichment nested
#   - Never raises — any failed fetch returns {} / [] gracefully
#   - Callable from both Streamlit pages and background scripts
# ============================================================

    """
    For each game in tonight's slate, pre-fetch all advanced enrichment data.

    For every game the following data is fetched (all optional/graceful):
    - Home & away team recent game logs (last 10)
    - Home & away team lineups (5-man units)
    - Player estimated metrics for all rostered players
    - Home & away team dashboard (home/away/days-rest splits)
    - Current league standings
    - Today's full scoreboard

    Results are cached aggressively via the nba_live_fetcher TTL cache so
    subsequent calls within the cache window are instant.

    Parameters
    ----------
    games : list[dict]
        Tonight's games as returned by ``get_todays_games()`` /
        ``get_schedule()``.  Each dict must contain at least one of:
        - ``game_id`` or ``GAME_ID`` — for live box-score lookups
        - ``home_team_id`` / ``HOME_TEAM_ID`` — NBA team ID for home side
        - ``away_team_id`` / ``VISITOR_TEAM_ID`` — NBA team ID for away side
    season : str | None
        Season string in 'YYYY-YY' format (e.g. '2025-26').  Defaults to
        the current season as determined by nba_live_fetcher.
    progress_callback : callable | None
        Optional callable invoked after each step:
        ``callback(current_step: int, total_steps: int, message: str)``
        Suitable for Streamlit progress bars.

    Returns
    -------
    dict[str, dict]
        Keyed by ``game_id`` (str).  Each value is a dict with keys:
        - ``game_id``          (str)
        - ``home_team_id``     (int | None)
        - ``away_team_id``     (int | None)
        - ``home_game_logs``   (list[dict])
        - ``away_game_logs``   (list[dict])
        - ``home_lineups``     (list[dict])
        - ``away_lineups``     (list[dict])
        - ``home_dashboard``   (dict)
        - ``away_dashboard``   (dict)
        - ``standings``        (list[dict])
        - ``player_metrics``   (list[dict])
        - ``scoreboard``       (dict)
        - ``fetch_time``       (float) — Unix timestamp of enrichment
