initial_pull.py
---------------
One-time seed script for the SmartPicksProAI database.

Fetches every player game log for the entire 2025-26 NBA regular season via
the nba_api LeagueGameLog endpoint, cleans and transforms the data with
Pandas, and loads it into the SQLite tables defined in setup_db.py.

Also seeds the Teams table from static data, populates Team_Game_Stats from
team-level game logs, loads Team_Roster / player positions via the
CommonTeamRoster endpoint, and populates advanced analytics tables including
career stats, clutch, hustle, shot chart, tracking, scoring, usage,
matchups, bio, estimated metrics, league dashboards, and league leaders.

Run this script exactly once to establish the historical baseline:
