    ),
    "best player": (
        "Right NOW? It's a two-man race between Nikola Jokic and "
        "Luka Doncic. Jokic does things with the basketball that "
        "shouldn't be POSSIBLE for a man his size. Luka is a "
        "generational TALENT. But don't sleep on Shai Gilgeous-Alexander — "
        "that man is ascending to SUPERSTARDOM!"
    ),

        "EXCUSE ME?! Joseph M. Smith has been doing this since BEFORE "

        "Stars play 40+ minutes, rotations SHRINK to 7-8 guys, "
        "defenses are LOCKED IN on the scouting report, and only the REAL ones survive. "
        "Role players disappear. Superstars FEAST. The refs swallow their whistles in the fourth. "
        "That's why my playoff analysis factors in postseason history, series fatigue, "
        "clutch splits, and ELIMINATION-game performance. Regular season numbers mean NOTHING now!"

        "GAME SEVEN! The two most beautiful words in ALL of sports! "
        "Winner goes home happy, loser goes home for the SUMMER. "

        "Some players SHRINK. Some players GROW. Joseph M. Smith knows the DIFFERENCE!"
    ),
    "series": (
        "Series basketball is CHESS, not checkers! Teams make adjustments game to game — "
        "the coaching matters MORE, the film study matters MORE, and matchup hunting becomes an ART. "
        "I track how players perform as a series DEEPENS. Some guys get BETTER with more games "
        "because they figure out the defense. Others get WORSE because the defense figures THEM out. "
        "That's the kind of analysis only Joseph M. Smith provides!"
    ),
    "elimination": (
        "ELIMINATION GAME! This is where you find out what a player is MADE of! "
        "Historically, SUPERSTARS elevate — LeBron, Jordan, Kobe, Duncan — they ALL turned it up "
        "when their season was on the line. But role players? They VANISH. "
        "My model adjusts for elimination-game history and I'm telling you — "
        "TRUST the stars. FADE the role players. That's the playoff FORMULA!"
    ),
    "finals": (
        "The NBA FINALS! The BIGGEST stage in basketball! "
        "Only SIXTEEN teams make the playoffs. Only TWO make the Finals. "
        "The pressure is IMMENSE. The minutes are HEAVY. The defense is SUFFOCATING. "
        "I adjust for Finals-level intensity — tighter rotations, slower pace, "
        "and the fact that EVERY player on that court is playing for their LEGACY!"
    ),
    "trade": (
        "Trades change EVERYTHING. New team, new role, new matchups. "
        "When a trade happens, I recalculate from SCRATCH. "
        "You can't just plug old numbers into a new situation — "
        "that's AMATEUR hour. Joseph M. Smith adjusts for CONTEXT!"
    ),
    "draft": (
        "The draft is where FUTURES are made. I look at college translations, "
        "physical profiles, and historical comps. "
        "But tonight we're focused on the CURRENT slate. "
        "Ask me about any player on tonight's games!"
    ),
    "over under": (
        "Over/Under is where the MONEY is! I analyze usage rates, pace, "
        "defensive matchups, and recent trends to find the props that are "
        "MISPRICED. My Neural Analysis crunches ALL of that for you. "
        "Run it and I'll show you where the value is!"
    ),
    "spread": (
        "Spreads are about matchups, pace, and home-court advantage. "
        "I factor in defensive ratings, offensive efficiency, and "
